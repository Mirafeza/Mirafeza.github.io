        <p class="introduction">Hey, you.<br>
        Yeah, I am talking to you, there's nobody else here right?<br>
        Now, welcome to my secret library! I stored lots of diaries and fanfictions here, feel free to check them out!<br>
        I am still learning how to build a webpage so it may seems quite clich√©. But don't worry, this library will be developed!<br>
        Have fun! XDDDDDDDDD

        <br>
            I visited <strong>the BROAD</strong> the day before yesterday, the collections there really amazed me and gave me lots of inspiration, <strong><em>Untitled(Your body is a battlegrond)</em> by Barbara Kruger</strong> and <strong><em>Double America 2</em> by Glenn Ligon</strong> are my favorite ones.

        I also went to the Getty Center and that was......<br>
